      <p>
        For ten years, I was a food-service employee. From making pizza at a
        high-end grocery store to serving as the pastry chef of a fine dining
        restaurant, I made learning, quality, and service my top priorities.
        Eating great food was a pretty nice perk, too. After years of 100-degree
        kitchens and countless oven scars, I knew that I had to find something
        better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork were always the highlights of
        my food-service career, and I see web development as a fitting next
        step. And maybe, with a little luck, I'll finally find a job that
        doesn't involve the occasional ER visit.
      </p>

        When I'm not working, you can find me rewatching the same shows on
        Netflix, trying out new recipes in the kitchen, or just hanging out with
        my wife, my dog, and my two cats.
